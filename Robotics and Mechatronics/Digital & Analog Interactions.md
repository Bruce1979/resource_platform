# Digital & Analog Interactions

## Suggested Program of Delivery

TBD

* WH & S
* Ethics & sustainability
* Project management (including planning, troubleshooting, and post-mortem evaluation)
* Complex input and output systems (including data gathering and storage, eg serialization and arrays)
* Testing flexibility/robustness of system (including data validation)
* Depending on unit focus, looking at relevant physics (energy usage/loss, aerodynamics, hydraulics, heat, light, levers, pulleys, & gears, etc)
* Cultural/ethical component (for example, official vs foreign knock-offs, why are they cheaper, 
* what are the consequences, data collection and ethical responsibilities, different cultures stance on data collection)
* Analogue vs digital
* ADC/DAC conversions and concepts
* Use a system of sensors or inputs
* Using historical data (including trends) to achieve meaningful output (processing and presenting raw data as readable information)
* Study complex sensors such as accelerometer, photoresistor, etc., the physics and science behind its operation, and a complex study of its outputs, eg, view output using multimeter or oscilloscope.

## Potential Assessment Tasks

### Task 1

Plan/research/design a circuit with integrated code. Consider the feasibility of manufacturing, powering, and disposing of 10 000 units of your circuit for hypothetical use.

### Task 2
Theory Test


### Task 3 
Prac Test



### Task 4

* E.g. Weather Station that reads temperature, humidity, etc, and outputs messages such as “rain expected”.
* Alternatively, a similar setup could be used to manage a small greenhouse, measuring temperature, sunlight, and humidity, and adjusting the greenhouses conditions for optimal plant growth https://core-electronics.com.au/tutorials/Weather_Station_with_Arduino_Tutorial.html
