| **Assessment:** 3 – 5 assessment tasks are mandated by the BSSS. The tasks here are designed to give you a starting point from which to work into your own teaching and learning strategies. Make sure you consult the BSSS guidelines, course document on assessment types and weightings to ensure that they meet the requirements stated. |                     |              |                       |

1.  The focus of this unit is on developing the students’ understanding of the
    building blocks of larger systems and developing the skills necessary to
    effectively design and develop digital assets for more complex data-driven
    systems.

2.  Students will develop the skills and knowledge required to interpret and
    create their own digital assets for a range of purposes and audiences.

3.  They analyse discrete components of existing processes and products,
    examining how they interact within a system and/or re-design and develop
    assets.

4.  Comprehensively apply a design process and develop the individual structures
    of data driven systems

5.  Critically analyse, create, evaluate, and modify digital assets

6.  Evaluate the nature and interactions of individual digital assets within the
    constraints of a larger system

7.  **Design Process**

8.  Critically analyse and apply a design process, evaluating opportunities and
    constraints, and explain the decision making when developing an asset

9.  Critically analyse and apply the elements and principles of the creation of
    digital assets, for example, sections of code, web pages or 3D models

10. Apply the design process to evaluate and develop the architecture of the
    building blocks of basic systems, for example, pseudocode, wireframes, or
    flowcharts

11. **Strategies, methodologies and procedures**

12. Evaluate strategies, tools, and processes required to produce digital assets

13. Research and investigate a range of appropriate digital assets and justify
    design decisions

14. Analyse the selection and use of specific production tools which are
    appropriate for constructing digital assets

15. Create a digital asset. For example, sections of code, web pages or 3D
    models

16. Design assets using computational, algorithmic and/or data-driven thinking

17. Apply strategies to work both independently and collaboratively in time
    sensitive environments

18. **Theories, concepts and materials**

19. Critically analyse the theories affecting the design and development of a
    digital asset. For example the importance of style guides, the theory of
    negative space in web design, and the polygon count for 3D model development

20. Critically analyse and apply fundamental computer science concepts for
    problem solving in the development of digital assets

21. Critically analyse the factors affecting the development of a digital asset
    within the context of its design environment

22. Critically analyse legal, social and ethical responsibilities associated
    with the development of digital assets

23. **Contexts**

24. Critically analyse how design is influenced by context including social,
    historical and cultural, and how the design of a digital assets may impact
    systems, solutions and projects

25. Critically analyse the human considerations and challenges involved in the
    design and development of digital assets. For example the ethical,
    environmental and legal contexts, or the development of controversial
    technology

26. **Communication**

27. Communicate accurately with others in an appropriate format both orally and
    in writing

28. Communicate ideas and insights in a range of appropriate mediums and justify
    ideas coherently

29. Explain the process of solving design problems and justify the choices made
    during the development of digital assets

30. Justify ideas coherently using appropriate evidence and accurate referencing

31. **Reflection**

32. Reflect on own learning style and performance including planning, time
    management to develop strategies to improve own learning.
