[Godot](https://godotengine.org/features) is an open source game engine and editor, which may make a good alternative to Unity.

Benefits:
* Better 2D support than Unity, which is more beginner-friendly than 3D.
* Open Source and fully free.
* Uses a scripting language which was based on Python - easier transition for students with some Python experience.
* Also supports C# scripting via Mono, if you do want to teach C# too.
* Less 'opinionated' than Unity, making it more approachable.  (At least in my experience - DS)

Godot has lots of tutorials avaiable in both text and video format, including many aimed at [kids](http://kidscancode.org/blog/2017/02/godot_101_01/).
