# Data Science resources, activities and tools

A high level overview of the topics explored across the 4 units of the Data Science course:

* Data representation
* Data analysis tools and techniques
* Spreadsheets
* Databases
* Data visualisation tools and techniques
* Big data
* Open data and APIs
* Machine learning

# Unit One: Data Representation and Analysis

## Concepts overview:

### What is Data?
* What is the history of Data?
  * DIKW pyramid
* What can data tell us?
* Why is this interesting?
* Looking at data, analysis and representation (visualisation)
  * Tell amazing stories using data
* Ethics of data

### Where do we get Data from?
* Data about people - collected from forms
* Environmental data - from the world directly (e.g. sensors)
* Data from actions (web browsing data) and inference
* Metadata - what is it?
* Arduino / Microbit programming - sensor data collection, transfer, storage
* Varieties of data
* Consider data collection issues:
  * Privacy and security
  * Legal considerations
  * Sustainability
  * Ethics
  * Bias/Distortions
  * Data Quality
* Availability of data:
  * [ACT Open Data Portal](https://www.data.act.gov.au/)

### How do we understand the limits of data?
* What can and cannot be represented by data?
* How “complete” is your data? What is missing? When is it complete enough?

### How do we model/represent data?
* Choices made in representation and collection can affect outcomes
* Modelling objects vs. events vs. relationships
* Quantitative vs qualitative
* What choices might be made in representing a quantity?

### How do we analyse data?
* Grouping
* Sorting
* Filtering
* Aggregation
* Summarisation
* Trend and pattern analysis
* Tools
  * Spreadsheets
  * Pandas / Numpy / Matplotlib / programming
* Correlation vs causation vs coincidence
  * Spurious correlations
* Consider data analysis issues:
  * Ethics
  * Bias/Distortions
  * Using data for decision-making (Centrelink?)

### How do we present data?
* Graphs - types, suitability, choices
* Summary statistics (compare suitability using Anscombe's quartet)
* Tables
* Animations (stretch goal) / interactive representations
* Looking at different visualisations 
  * [US Gun Deaths](https://guns.periscopic.com/?year=2013)
  * [Google Public Data - Life Expectancy vs Fertility Rate](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&ctype=b&strail=false&nselm=s&met_x=sp_dyn_le00_in&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&met_s=sp_pop_totl&scale_s=lin&ind_s=false&dimp_c=country:region&ifdim=country&iconSize=0.5&uniSize=0.035)
  * [Worldometers - Real time data](https://www.worldometers.info/)
* Abuses of presentation
  * inconsistent scales
* Develop narratives (through presentations)

# Unit Two: Big Data Analysis and Techniques

## Concepts overview:

### What makes data "big"? How is it different from data?
* How is big data represented?
* Where is it stored?
* How does it travel?
* 4 Vs of big data:
  * Volume
  * Velocity
  * Variety
  * Veracity

### What are the issues raised by Big Data?
* Ethical issues
* Privacy
* Security
* Storage Requirements
* Sustainability
* Decision-making systems

### If Big Data is the tool, what is the problem?
* problems solvable using big data
* why is big data required?

### Big Data Management
* Connectivity, APIs, (cannot take all the data at once, cannot store it locally)
* structured storage & APIs (databases) (Volume)
* SQL and NoSQL (Variety)
* XML & JSON
* summarisation and filtering (Velocity)

### Big Data Analysis
* Trend Analysis
* Cluster Analysis
* MapReduce
* Slicing, Dicing, etc.

### Big Data Visualisation
* look at geospatial data and mapping
* animations
* interactions

### Big Data and Decision Making
* how to make a decision based on your analysis
* good decisions vs bad decisions
* Coincidence correlation causation

### Telling stories with big data
* Applying Big Data techniques to new data sets; building narratives and uncovering stories.
